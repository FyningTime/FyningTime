# FyningTime

FyningTime (based on the Go framework Fyne) helps to tracks down your work time.  

Features which are planned:

* âœ… Add/Edit/Delete time
* Auto update feature (based on Github deployed package)
* Customize your time table as you wish
* âœ… Everything is local (sqlite) no data will be exposed or tracked (sadly it's a feature)
* By wish, the app starts/ends automatically by startup/shutdown and tracks beginning of your work day. (Next day you can review it anyway ðŸ˜¬)
* Customize the app
* Create a notification warning if you work too long! (It would be sad if you work too long. ðŸ˜‰)
* Vacation planning
* Calendar view
* Import your excel where you tracked your worktime  
* See how much overwork you did
