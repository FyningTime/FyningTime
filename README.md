# FyningTime

FyningTime (based on the Go framework Fyne) helps to tracks down your work time.  

Features which are planned:

* Add/Edit/Delete time
* Auto update feature (based on Github deployed package)
* Customize your time table as you wish
* Everything is local (sqlite) no data will be exposed or tracked (sadly it's a feature)
* By wish, the app starts/ends automatically by startup/shutdown and tracks beginning of your work day. (Next day you can review it anyway ðŸ˜¬)
* Customize the app (e.g. primary/secondary colors)
